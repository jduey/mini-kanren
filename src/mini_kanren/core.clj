(comment
  This file is the result of implementing the logic programming system described
  in "The Reasoned Schemer", called mini-kanren, in Clojure.  I was struggling
  to understand the material in the book without a concrete system to work with,
  so I decided to implement the system in the book to aid my understanding.

  "The Reasoned Schemere" is the third book in the "Little Schemer" series of books
  that explain the Scheme programming language and various aspects of programming
  in Scheme.  "The Reasoned Schemer" extends Scheme to include logic programming like
  Prolog and the pattern maching in Erlang.  The first six chapters introduce the 
  syntax and semantics of this extension, which is what this file covers.

  I chose to pretty much lift the logic function names directly from the book to make
  learning the material easier.  Though there are some differences which should be 
  easily discerned by comparing the code to the book.

  There are two areas that required some work to implement this system in Clojure.

  First, in the book's implementation, logic variables are represented as vectors.
  I chose to represent logic variables as keywords, for reasons explained later.  So,
  the following definition creates a logic variable.  Each time an lvar is created,
  it is assigned a unique name using the gensym facility provided by Clojure.)

; a couple of special symbols
  
(def _ '_)
(def | '|)

; working with logic variables

(defn lvar
 "Creating a unique logic variable that has no value assigned"
  []
  (str (gensym (str "lvar__"))))

(defn lvar?
  "Determine if a value is an logic variable or not."
  [x]
  (and (string? x)
       (.startsWith x "lvar")))

(comment
  The second area of work stems from the fact that Clojure does not use cons cells
  to hold elements of lists.  The book made heavy use of this feature of Scheme and
  so a special version of cons had to be defined.  Passing an item and a list caused
  the item to be added at the head of the list.  Both of those cases were easy to
  account for.  The third case is when the second parameter to cons is not a list,
  causing cons to create a dotted pair where the cdr of the cons cell is a value, not
  a pointer to the rest of the list.  This aspect of cons is used heavily in the book
  to represent lists where the cdr may be undefined.  Since this was a required feature,
  I chose to implement an incomplete list by adding a :tail item to the meta data of a
  literal list, if the second parameter to cons is an lvar.  This worked very well.
  
  This also meant that a special version of 'next' had to be defined to handle incomplete lists.)

(defn- is-seq? [l]
  (or (seq? l)
      (set? l)
      (vector? l)))

(defn lcons [a b]
  "cons a value onto a logic seq"
  (cond
    (nil? b) (list a)
    (is-seq? b) (with-meta (cons a b) (meta b))
    (lvar? b) (with-meta (list a) {:tail b})
    :else (cons a b)))

(defn- lseq? [l]
"test if a value is logic sequence or not
an empty sequence is not a valid logic sequence"
  (and (is-seq? l)
       (not (empty? l))))

(defn incomplete [l t]
"make a logic sequence that is incomplete, the rest of the
sequence is in the tail"
	  (with-meta l {:tail t}))

(defn- lnext [l]
  "get everything but the first element of a logic sequence"
  (let [nl (rest l)]
    (cond
      (= (first nl) |) (second nl)
      (and (empty? nl) (:tail (meta l))) (:tail (meta l))
      (empty? nl) []
      :else (with-meta nl (meta l)))))

(comment
  Values are assigned to logic variables through a mechanism called substitution.  In
  the book's implementation, this was accomplished through the use of an associative
  list, which is basically a list of cons cells where the car of the cell is the key
  and the cdr of the cell is the value.  Clojure has the hash-map data type which is
  a natural replacement for an associative list.  Using a hash-map to hold a substitution,
  the use of keywords for logic variables means that retrieval of a variable's value is
  simply a get operation on the map with that variable.)

; operations on substitutions

; this is what a substitution looks like, 'e is a value, :x and :y are
; logic variables:
;
; the keys in a substitution may only be keywords
; {:y 'e :x :y}

; the values in a substitution may be:
; 	a symbol
; 	a keyword (may or may not be a key in the substitution)
; 	a literal list
